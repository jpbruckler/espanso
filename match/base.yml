# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
  - trigger: ":ts"
    replace: "{{timestamp}}"
    vars:
      - name: timestamp
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%+"
  - trigger: ":ld"
    replace: "â€”"
  - trigger: ":copchain"
    replace: "A 22-inch copper ball chain is included with this purchase."
  - trigger: ":ogbox"
    replace: "For an additional fee, this pendant can be shipped in a sturdy, handcrafted origami gift box."
  - trigger: ":ojs"
    replace: "Overall jewelry size is "
  - trigger: ".t"
    replace: "	"
  - trigger: ":t"
    replace: "	"
  - trigger: ":2t"
    replace: "		"
